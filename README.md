Simple app retrieving current weather conditions from external api

This simple application fetches the actual weather information for the selected location from AccuWeather server. The author's unique ApiKey has been obfuscated through an external AppSettings.config file, which has not been added to this repository.
To enable the functionality contact with the author in order to obtain the missing file or create your own surrogate ApiKey from the providers website: https://developer.accuweather.com/ and paste inside the App.config file
